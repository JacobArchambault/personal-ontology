# personal-ontology
A growing ontology, that is, an organized categorization of reality into various types, starting from simple information about myself and branching out via logical entailments. 

This ontology may be construed as an exercise in 'world making', in the sense found in the philosophy of Nelson Goodman. It operates on the assumption that the ability to understand a specific type as that type presupposes its distinction from other types near to it, and that the ability to understand a given generic type as such presupposes the existence of distinct subclasses. E.g. In a world where the only entities are humans, the concept 'animal', which serves to distinguish humans and other animal types from each other, cannot serve its purpose, and consequently does not exist as a concept distinct from that of 'human'.

Because of the above the ontology aims to be minimalist in its explicit assumptions at any given time, adjusting as new entities and entity types are added.
